 * locate any item in any tree in the file system.
 *
 * btrfs_key objects only exists in memory and is in CPU byte order.
 * btrfs_disk_key is identical to btrfs_key except that objectid and offset are in
 * little endian (disk) byte order and are part of the file system on-disk format.

     * of the tree where the tree block is located.
